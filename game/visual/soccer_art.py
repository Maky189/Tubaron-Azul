"""Builds the per-team player sprites from the three base poses.

There is one base outfield pose (Cape Verde blue kit), one kicking pose, and one
diving keeper. Every other nation is produced by recolouring the kit: the blue
shirt is hue-swapped to the team's shirt colour and the yellow keeper to the
team's keeper colour. The base renders are Cape Verde players, so for every other
nation the brown skin is also relit to a lighter tone to match those squads. Each
set is built once and cached.
